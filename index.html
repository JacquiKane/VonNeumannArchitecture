        <p>
            In 1946, John Von Neumann (principal author), Arthur Burks and Herman Goldstine described a theoretical design for a computer that stored programs. Prior to this, large computers were programmed manually, using switches - so the ability to store instructions was a huge innovation.

            <p>
                Data and instructions stored together, if the instructions could be stored in the same electronic memory that held the data, they could be accessed as quickly as needed. This made High Level Languages (HLL) possible.

         <p>Von Neumann architecture became the basis for modern computer architecture.</p>
         <p>Modern computers include memory, a processor (encompassing the logic unit and controller), a distinct fetch cycle, and mechanisms for input and output.</p>

<!-- ENIAC -->
<button class="accordion">ENIAC? EDVAC?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator & Computer) was the first electronic programmable computer.The ENIAC had to be rewired to solve different problems.</p>
  <p>The EDVAC(1949), Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer, was a successor to the ENIAC. John Von Neumann's document, <i>First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC</i>, proposed the "stored-program" concept that embodies the Von Neumann architecture - storing of the program in the same memory as the data. The British computers EDSAC at Cambridge and the Manchester Baby were the first working computers that followed this design. And it has been followed by the great majority of computers made since. Having the program and data in different memories is called the Harvard architecture.
